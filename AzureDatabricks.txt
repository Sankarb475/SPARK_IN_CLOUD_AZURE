Azure Databricks is an Apache Spark-based analytics platform optimized for the Microsoft Azure cloud services platform.
Azure Databricks is a fast, easy, and collaborative Apache Spark-based analytics service. For a big data pipeline, the data 
(raw or structured) is ingested into Azure through Azure Data Factory in batches, or streamed near real- time using Kafka, 
Event Hub, or IoT Hub. This data lands in a data lake for long term persisted storage, in Azure Blob Storage or Azure Data 
Lake Storage. As part of your analytics workflow, use Azure Databricks to read data from multiple data sources such as Azure 
Blob Storage, Azure Data Lake Storage, Azure Cosmos DB, or Azure SQL Data Warehouse and turn it into breakthrough insights 
using Spark.

Azure Databricks comprises the complete open-source Apache Spark cluster technologies and capabilities.

Apache Spark in Azure Databricks ::
Azure Databricks builds on the capabilities of Spark by providing a zero-management cloud platform that includes::

Fully managed Spark clusters ::
Azure Databricks has a secure and reliable production environment in the cloud, managed and supported by Spark experts.
1) creating clusters in seconds
2) Dynamically autoscale clusters up and down, including serverless clusters, and share them across teams.
3) Use clusters programmatically by using the REST APIs.
4) Use secure data integration capabilities built on top of Spark that enable you to unify your data without centralization
5) Get instant access to the latest Apache Spark features with each release.

Databricks Runtime :: 
The Databricks Runtime is built on top of Apache Spark and is natively built for the Azure cloud.
With the Serverless option, Azure Databricks completely abstracts out the infrastructure complexity and the need for 
specialized expertise to set up and configure your data infrastructure. The Serverless option helps data scientists iterate 
quickly as a team. For data engineers, who care about the performance of production jobs, Azure Databricks provides a Spark 
engine that is faster and performant through various optimizations at the I/O layer and processing layer (Databricks I/O).

An interactive workspace for exploration and visualization ::
Through a collaborative and integrated environment, Azure Databricks streamlines the process of exploring data, prototyping, 
and running data-driven applications in Spark.

1) Determine how to use data with easy data exploration.
2) Document your progress in notebooks in R, Python, Scala, or SQL.
3) Visualize data in a few clicks, and use familiar tools like Matplotlib, ggplot, or d3.
4) Use interactive dashboards to create dynamic reports.
5) Use Spark and interact with the data simultaneously.

A platform for powering your favorite Spark-based applications.

Enterprise security ::
Azure Databricks provides enterprise-grade Azure security, including Azure Active Directory integration, role- based controls,
and SLAs that protect your data and your business.
